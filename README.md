Twitter Sentiment Analysis – NLP & Machine Learning Project
Duration: Apr 2024 – Jun 2024
Technologies: Python, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, NLTK, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Pandas, TF-IDF, Bag-of-Words

Project Overview
This project implements a sentiment analysis pipeline to classify tweets as positive, negative, or neutral, providing valuable insights into public opinions on various topics. The solution uses advanced feature extraction techniques, including TF-IDF and Bag-of-Words, and machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and XGBoost to classify tweet sentiments.

Key Features
Sentiment Classification: Classifies tweets into positive, negative, or neutral categories using machine learning models.

Feature Extraction: Utilizes TF-IDF and Bag-of-Words techniques to transform raw tweet text data into numerical features for analysis.

Model Building: Implements Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and XGBoost classifiers, fine-tuned for optimal F1-score performance using probabilistic thresholds.

Hashtag & Sentiment Analysis: Extracts hashtags from tweets and visualizes their impact on sentiment through frequency distributions and bar plots.

Data Visualization: Uses Seaborn and Matplotlib for visualizing sentiment trends, hashtag analysis, and word frequency across positive and negative tweets.
